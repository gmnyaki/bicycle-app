# Bicycle Class and PHPUnit Tests
This demonstrates the implementation of a Bicycle class in PHP using the Laravel framework, along with PHPUnit tests to ensure the functionality of the class.

## Overview 
This demonstrates the implementation of a Bicycle class in PHP using the Laravel framework, along with PHPUnit tests to ensure the functionality of the class.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- PHP installed on your development environment.
- Composer installed to manage project dependencies.
- A Laravel project set up (if you want to integrate the Bicycle class into an existing Laravel project).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/gmnyaki/bicycle-app.git  

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd bicycle-app

```
3. Install the project dependencies using Composer:

```

```
## Bicycle Class
The Bicycle class encapsulates the properties and functionality of a bicycle, including color, brand, and speed. 
You can use this class to create and manage Bicycle objects.
## Usage
To use the application, open a web browser and navigate to the URL(http://bicycle-app.test) . Once the page loads you can navigate to URL(http://bicycle-app.test/ride-bike) to see the output of the class.
## Running PHPUnit Tests
PHPUnit tests have been provided to verify the functionality of the Bicycle class. To run these tests, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you are in the project directory:
```
cd bicycle-app

```
2. Run PHPUnit using Composer:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit

```
or
